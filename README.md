#### By _**Nick Ramsey**_

## Description

_Our internal dashboard automatically names downloads based on account, project, filters, etc. One client was hoping we could rename the files to something more simple to identify. They had 200+ files needing to be renamed. To avoid errors and tedious work, I wrote a python script to automate this._
